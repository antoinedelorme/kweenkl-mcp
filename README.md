# kweenkl MCP Server

> **ðŸš€ PRE-LAUNCH:** kweenkl is currently in pre-launch mode. Join our early access program to get notifications from your AI assistant!

MCP (Model Context Protocol) server that allows AI assistants to send kweenkl notifications.

## What is kweenkl?

The verb "kweenkl" means to send a notification using kweenkl. When an AI can "kweenkl" you, it transforms from a conversational tool into an active assistant that can tap you on the shoulder when needed.

## Pre-Launch Access

kweenkl is currently in pre-launch. During this phase:
- The service is fully functional and ready to use
- We're gathering feedback from early adopters
- Official launch coming soon with more features
