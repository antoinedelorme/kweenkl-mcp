# kweenkl MCP Server

> **ðŸš€ PRE-LAUNCH:** kweenkl is currently in pre-launch mode. Join our early access program to get notifications from your AI assistant!

MCP (Model Context Protocol) server that allows AI assistants to send kweenkl notifications.

## What is kweenkl?

The verb "kweenkl" means to send a notification using kweenkl. When an AI can "kweenkl" you, it transforms from a conversational tool into an active assistant that can tap you on the shoulder when needed.

## Pre-Launch Access

kweenkl is currently in pre-launch. During this phase:
- The service is fully functional and ready to use
- We're gathering feedback from early adopters
- Official launch coming soon with more features

**Try it now with our demo webhook token:** `51fa2b2d-2080-4a73-b059-7e67712d93f7`

npm install
```

### Other MCP Clients

Consult your MCP client's documentation for stdio server configuration. The server requires:
- Node.js executable
- Path to index.js

## Usage

Once configured, ask your AI assistant:

- "kweenkl me when you're done"
- "Send a high priority kweenkl about the deployment"
- "kweenkl the team with the summary"

### Example Interactions

**Basic notification:**
```
User: "kweenkl me with 'Hello World'"
AI: I'll send that notification now.
Response: âœ… Successfully kweenkled! ðŸ“± 1 subscriber(s) notified
```

**With priority:**
```
User: "Send a high priority kweenkl about the server being down"
AI: I'll send a high priority notification.
Response: âœ… Successfully kweenkled! ðŸ“± 3 subscriber(s) notified
```

**Contextual notification:**
```
User: "Analyze this log file and kweenkl me if you find errors"
AI: I'll analyze the log file now.
[AI analyzes file and finds errors]
AI: Found 5 errors. I'll kweenkl you with the summary.
Response: âœ… Successfully kweenkled!
```
